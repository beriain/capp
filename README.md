capp
====

Simple tool designed to take a break in those long working days. Relax, let capp work and go for a coffee

Highly inspired by cappuccino for Debian, give it a try ;-) (https://packages.debian.org/wheezy/cappuccino).

Tested with latest Firefox

The version with buttons is more elegant, but as far as the randomly generated sentences have no sense, maybe it's better not to pause the loading so the sentences can hardly be read.
Feel free to adapt it to your needs

Tip: Press F11 to go fullscreen and have a better effect
